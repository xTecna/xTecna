### Welcome to my repository! ðŸ˜„

I'm Raquel Marcolino (she/her), better known as Tecna, I'm 27 years old and I am currently pursuing a Doctors degree in Artificial Intelligence (check out my 2048 and Checkers repositories if you want to see what I'm currently working on on my thesis).

I have 3+ years of professional experience as a Backend Developer working with tools such as C#, ASP.NET, PowerShell, Windows Forms and all that Windows jazz, but in my free time, I love to delve more onto two different areas: Algorithms (as this was my Master's theme and my lifelong passion) and Web Development, mainly with the HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack but I'm currently learning React a lot with my current magnum opus (my LoR Tournament Overlay repository), making several projects to aid the Legends of Runeterra community.

But enough with words, let's see my projects and what I've done currently. Hope you like it and it's a pleasure having you here! Hope you have a nice week! If you want to continue this conversation, please add me on Twitter and DM me! I'm open to everything, from casual chatter to job offers.
